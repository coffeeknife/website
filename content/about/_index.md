i'm robin, a married butch. this site serves as an archival/publishing place for my stuff about:

- linux, self-hosting, hardware, corporation-free internet, etc.
- chronic illness/disability
- arts & crafts (bookbinding, knitting, sewing, some minimal handyman stuff)
- honestly really anything that captures my interest, although i'm more likely to post abt anime/games/etc on bluesky

this site was built with [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [nightfall](https://github.com/LordMathis/hugo-theme-nightfall) theme
